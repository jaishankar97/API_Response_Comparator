# API_Response_Comparator

Python scripts and comparison files to compare two API's

The main program for the problem i.e. to compare two file consists of API's is in src/app.py. The idea here is to open two text files in folder 'data' and compare each line simultaneously for example, the api's at line 1 in both files will be compared together, then at line2, and so on rather than first comparing first api link from file 1 with all the links of file 2.

To execute the program for comparing two files, go to command line, change the location to the folder where the 'src' and 'test' folders are located, and run the command: python3 src/app.py.

To execute the testing conditions programs, go to the same above mentioned location, and run the command: python3 test/test_app.py.
